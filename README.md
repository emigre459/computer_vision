# Computer Vision via Transfer Learning - Flower Species Identification

In this project, I developed code for an image classifier (starting with the pre-trained Inception v3 and DenseNet 161 models) built with PyTorch, then converted it into a command line application.

The models were trained using 8,500 pre-labeled images of 102 different flower species provided as part of this project by Udacity.com.

# Pre-Trained Model

The best model used in this repo was trained on a Udacity.com-provided GPU-enabled workspace and the resulting checkpoint file that contains the model itself is too large to be uploaded to GitHub. As such, you can [download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rnrbw744m8gzzm2/flowers_checkpoint.pth?dl=0).
