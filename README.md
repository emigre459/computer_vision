# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

# Pre-Trained Model

The best model used in this repo was trained on a Udacity-provided GPU-enabled workspace and the resulting checkpoint file that contains the model itself is too large to be uploaded to GitHub. As such, you can [download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rnrbw744m8gzzm2/flowers_checkpoint.pth?dl=0).
